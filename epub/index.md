  - Typefoundry of Pieter van Rosmalen who designed the custom font "Hangil" for the south korean road signage. [Source - Webarchive - studiobar.com - South Korea Road Signage](https://web.archive.org/web/20130424134919/http://studiodumbar.com/work/south-korean-road-signage)
    - Panno is the english counterpart for "Hangil"
      - [Panno Sign](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/panno-sign)
      - [Panno Text](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/panno-text)
      - Used by [University of Gent](https://www.ugent.be/)
- [Garage Fonts](https://garagefonts.com/)

#### Font selection

[Panno Text](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/panno-text) is a suitable font I could use which also has a reference to Studio Dumbar(used for South Korea Road Signage).
Studio Dumbar currently uses Neue Haas Grotesk, which is modern version of Helvetica.

### Format

- iPad Pro 12.9 (1024 x 1366)
- landscape, can be used to present on the beamer and also works on the iPad

### Tool

I will use <u>Figma</u> as I want to use it for my personal work and also be more independent of Adobe programs.

### Storytelling

#### Ideas

- Gert Dumbar - "Oh and another thing is don’t use Helvetica please!" [Medium - Gert Dumbar in an Interview with Graham Sturt](https://medium.com/dutch-design-heroes/dutch-design-heroes-gert-dumbar-17cde989261d)
  - Studio Dumbar now uses Haas Grotesk, which is originated from Helvetica. [Linotype - Neue Haas Grotesk](https://www.linotype.com/de/6598/neue-haas-grotesk.html)
- Create a visual identity for Studio Dumbar
- Analyze works and describe a possible way of work to achieve the results that they achieved
- Create a critical view on this design studio
  - As cool and thoughtful as the projects are, Studio Dumbar does not seem to include political factors into the selection of their clients. For me personally, it would be hard to work for a studio like this.
  - Do other clients, that also work with Studio Dumbar, take previous of their projects into account before going with Studio Dumbar?
- Use Dutch Police vehicle striping for the design
- Use elements like the centered badge from the work for the Dutch Government
- Create something musical inspired
  - Like MTV VMAs
  - Like Amsterdam Sinfonietta

#### Studio Dumbar on strategy/identity

> ##### Strategic positioning
> What is the role you want to play in the life of your target audience; now, and in the future? We define the core answer to this question, in a clear and compelling way. Strategic positioning is foundational to our branding projects. It provides a compass for design, motion, sound, technology, communication–and much more.

> ##### Visual Identity
> Communicating who you are, without words; that’s how we see visual identity. Regardless of potential complexities and dynamics in your organisation; our mission is to express the personality of your brand in a strong, distinctive and appealing way. 

> ##### Motion identity
> As brands live on screen most of the time, being static is not an option. Motion is a crucial part of your visual behavior. We bring brands to life, defining how they move and interact; in marketing-communication, but also in-product, in-app.

> ##### Sound identity
> Sound adds an undeniable dimension of emotion to branding. Tuned to the right moments and touch points, sound is essential in creating atmosphere and strengthening recognition.

> ##### Integrated branding
> We bring motion, sound and visual design together to create a dynamic, meaningful and future-focused brand. We want to build brands that make impact across all touch points and channels, in every part of the customer journey. We make sure your brand is heard and seen.
