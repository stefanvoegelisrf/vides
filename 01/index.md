### Feedback

- use oblique lines
- Make statement bigger and provocative, add helvetica only small with small hint to switzerland
- Make the poster opposing to the message
- Make the helvetia drafts cleaner, add a small layer adding something more fine
- use the format, don't work too centered
- With the poster, attention has to be grabbed, how to achieve?
- Add year and name as small info
