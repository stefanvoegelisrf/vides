Studio Dumbar is a highly influential Dutch graphic design agency¹¹⁴. It was founded by Gert Dumbar in 1977, in the Hague¹¹⁴. The intent behind the creation of Studio Dumbar was to establish an international design agency specialized in visual branding and online branding¹⁵.

## History and Notable Projects
In 2003, the studio moved to Rotterdam, as Michel de Boer took over the creative direction, after Gert Dumbar's retirement¹. In 2011, Liza Enebeis became the studio's third creative director¹. The studio was acquired by Dept, a digital marketing firm, in 2016¹.

Studio Dumbar's work in the early 1980s was fragmented, sometimes complex to the edge of chaos, and layered with complex typography. This caused consternation among advocates of a more ordered aesthetic¹. However, by the late 1980s many European designers were mimicking Studio Dumbar's approach¹.

The studio has been recognized with numerous awards over the years, including the European Design Awards - Agency of the year 2023¹, Communication Arts Typography Competition - Award of Excellence 2019¹, The Webby Awards - Honoree 2018¹, and many more.

## Contexts of Work
Studio Dumbar has a diverse clientele, working with a mix of cultural, business, governmental, and non-profit backgrounds¹⁴. They value the interaction between different types of work and clients, and believe that the cultural work is important for business-oriented projects and vice versa¹⁴. They work for a variety of clients, from leading global tech companies, to local businesses, NGOs, governments, non-profit organizations and cultural institutes⁷.

## Important Works
Studio Dumbar has been recognized with numerous awards over the years for their outstanding work. Some of their important works include organizing the world’s largest motion design festival – DEMO 2022¹⁷, and their work on D&AD 2022¹³. They have also done groundbreaking design work for the Dutch police, the city of Rotterdam, Alzheimer Nederland & Amsterdam Sinfonietta¹⁴.

## Style and Design Attributes
Studio Dumbar's style is characterized by its complexity and layered approach with typography. Their designs are sometimes fragmented and can be complex to the edge of chaos³. This unique style has had a significant influence on European design. They are known for creating highly recognizable bold and iconic logos[^10^].

## Work Strategy
Studio Dumbar describes itself as “an international design agency specialized in visual branding and online branding”¹³. Strategic positioning is foundational to their branding projects. It provides a compass for design, motion, sound, technology, communication–and much more¹. They often work with freelancers or small agencies when they want to add a kind of specialist expertise to a project team¹¹. Their full funnel approach merges brand and performance strategies underpinned by solid data strategy and platform creativity¹¹. This approach is key to providing unified customer experiences, expanding market presence, and maximizing customer value¹¹.
