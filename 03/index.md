## Analysis

- minimalistic
- bold usage of fonts(big text, changing text sizes dynamically)
  - stretching out text for motion
    - E.g. [Amsterdam Sinfonietta identity](https://studiodumbar.com/work/amsterdam-sinfonietta-identity)
  - creating geometric forms with text
- working with repetition to create patterns
  - E.g. [Imagine Everything](https://studiodumbar.com/work/imagine-everything-d-ad)
- Bright colors, with big areas of color
  - E.g. [MTV VMAS 2022](https://studiodumbar.com/work/mtv-vmas-2022)
- usage of custom fonts
- motion is involved in a lot of projects, also in projects that do not involve animation or video, the elements have influences of motion
- using very simple recognizable elements that can be applied across different media, e.g. The Dutch Government uses the banner in the middle.
- strong in creating a visual identity that can be applied different media
