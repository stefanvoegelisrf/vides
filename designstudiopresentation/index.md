## Short biography

In 2003, the studio moved to Rotterdam, as Michel de Boer took over the creative direction, after Gert Dumbar's retirement. In 2011, Liza Enebeis became the studio's third creative director. The studio was acquired by [DEPT agency](https://www.deptagency.com/), a digital marketing firm, in 2016.

Studio Dumbar's work in the early 1980s was fragmented, sometimes complex to the edge of chaos, and layered with complex typography. This caused consternation among advocates of a more ordered aesthetic. However, by the late 1980s many European designers were mimicking Studio Dumbar's approach.


## Context

Studio Dumbar describes itself as “an international design agency specialized in visual branding and online branding”. Strategic positioning is foundational to their branding projects. It provides a compass for design, motion, sound, technology, communication–and much more. They often work with freelancers or small agencies when they want to add a kind of specialist expertise to a project team. Their full funnel approach merges brand and performance strategies underpinned by solid data strategy and platform creativity. This approach is key to providing unified customer experiences, expanding market presence, and maximizing customer value.

Studio Dumbar has a diverse clientele, working with a mix of cultural, business, governmental, and non-profit backgrounds. They value the interaction between different types of work and clients, and believe that the cultural work is important for business-oriented projects and vice versa. They work for a variety of clients, from leading global tech companies, to local businesses, NGOs, governments, non-profit organizations and cultural institutes.

The studio has been recognized with numerous awards over the years, including the European Design Awards - Agency of the year 2023, Communication Arts Typography Competition - Award of Excellence 2019, The Webby Awards - Honoree 2018, and many more.

## Analysis

Studio Dumbar's style is characterized by its complexity and layered approach with typography. Their designs are sometimes fragmented and can be complex to the edge of chaos. This unique style has had a significant influence on European design. They are known for creating highly recognizable bold and iconic logos.

- minimalistic
- bold usage of fonts(big text, changing text sizes dynamically)
  - stretching out text for motion
    - E.g. [Amsterdam Sinfonietta identity](https://studiodumbar.com/work/amsterdam-sinfonietta-identity)
  - creating geometric forms with text
- working with repetition to create patterns
  - E.g. [Imagine Everything](https://studiodumbar.com/work/imagine-everything-d-ad)
- Bright colors, with big areas of color
  - E.g. [MTV VMAS 2022](https://studiodumbar.com/work/mtv-vmas-2022)
- usage of custom fonts
- motion is involved in a lot of projects, also in projects that do not involve animation or video, the elements have influences of motion
- using very simple recognizable elements that can be applied across different media, e.g. The Dutch Government uses the banner in the middle.
- strong in creating a visual identity that can be applied different media
